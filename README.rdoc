== Trying out Refinery CMS

== Notes:
* Uses rails 3.2.19
* Great if you have a heavy backend
* Not great for setting up front-end-centric user interface -- giving the client a giant wysiwyg is NOT ideal -- would like to segment pages into more specific sections that would be a text box, image, file, etc. -- maybe can do this with more hacking?
